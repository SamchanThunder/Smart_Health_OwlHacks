OwlHacks 2024 Winning Project for Smart Health Track

We realize that innovation comes not only in the form of creating something new, but can also be in the form of making existing resources more accessible to all. Many sick individuals think of not of their health as the main priority but of the price tag that comes along with improving their health. Realizing that the healthcare industry has strayed towards being more about the profit margins as opposed to the health of customers, we decided to create CareCompare to find the most affordable options to medication.
